Global Context Server is part of an Undergraduate Computer Science final year project at Brunel University. It aims to 
solve two issues: 

- Academic software repository mining not being made of use to industrial developers.
- Information required by developers is scattered across a vast enumeration of services, depleting large amounts of 
cognitive effort that would be better used to developing solutions to problems.
