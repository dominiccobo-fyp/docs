### Language Support

- The current implementation is very Java heavy.
- A lot of mining data is performed in Python and other scripting languages. 

There is a current interest in GraalVM for polyglot development or moving away 
from a Java centric message bus towards RabbitMQ, or others. 

### Improving the Response Model

- Current response model is very inflexible. 
- Lacks the ability to provide metadata useful for presentation / aggregation.

### IDE Agnostic Plugins

- Currently the data-flow is mostly uni-directional. 
- Enabling bidirectional communication could fully fledged plugins to be developed 
multiple IDEs with little effort.

### Greater Metrics

- Having truly universal platforms could enable greater insight / measurement of their usage. 
- Ultimately, subject to privacy concerns.
